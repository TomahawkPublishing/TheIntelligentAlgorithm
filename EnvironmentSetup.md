## 🏗️ 1. Environment & Setup: The Conda Guide

To ensure your research engine runs predictably, you must **isolate your workspace**. [cite_start]Think of a **Virtual Environment** as a sealed "clean room" where you define exactly which tools are on the shelves to prevent "Dependency Hell" and library conflicts [cite: 817-819, 822, 1082].

### **Step 1: Install your Distributor**
[cite_start]Before creating an environment, you need a distribution manager to act as the "landlord" of your building [cite: 779-780, 826].

* **Anaconda:** The full-featured "landlord." [cite_start]It comes pre-packaged with an extensive library of data science tools [cite: 781-783, 826].
* [cite_start]**Miniforge/Miniconda:** A lighter, "bare-bones" version for those looking to save disk space and system resources [cite: 784-785].

### **Step 2: Create the "Workshop"**
Open your terminal (or Anaconda Prompt) to create your isolated room. [cite_start]We recommend using **Python 3.11** for maximum compatibility with institutional financial APIs and modern LLM libraries [cite: 820-823].

```bash
# Create an environment named 'fortress'
conda create -n fortress python=3.11
Step 3: Activate the Environment
You must "enter" the room before you can begin your research or run any scripts .

Bash
conda activate fortress
Step 4: Install the Essentials
Once inside, use the provided requirements.txt to install the complete "toolbox" required for this repository in one go .


Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
The Setup Hierarchy
To maintain a stable development environment, always follow this "Workforce Hierarchy" :

Distributor: Anaconda (The Landlord).

Environment: Your fortress workshop (The Locked Room).

Interface: VS Code or Jupyter (The Workbench).

💡 Pro-Tip: Always launch your code editor (like VS Code) from within the activated environment in your terminal. This ensures your workbench "sees" and uses the specific tools you have installed for this project .
